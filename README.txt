README: Library Management System Integrated to Database

Welcome to our Library Management System! This Python-based system offers a 
comprehensive solution for managing library operations, with seamless integration 
with a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Key Features:

Book Operations: Developers can utilize the system to add, search, borrow, and 
return books programmatically, with functions for adding new books, searching by 
ISBN, title, or author, and managing borrowing and returning processes.

User Management: The system provides functionalities for adding new users, 
viewing user details, and tracking borrowed books for each user through code 
interfaces.

Author Management: Developers can easily integrate author management functionalities, 
such as adding new authors, accessing author details, and listing all authors stored 
in the database, into their applications.

Genre Management: The system offers code-based capabilities for adding new genres, 
viewing genre descriptions, and displaying all available genres, enabling developers 
to enhance library cataloging and organization programmatically.

To ensure data integrity, the system includes validation checks for ISBNs, library 
IDs, and publication dates. With its intuitive code interfaces, this Library Management 
System simplifies development tasks, providing a robust foundation for building custom 
library management applications.
